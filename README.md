SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Web Services facilitate communication between applications over a network using XML-based messaging. They enable platform-independent and language-agnostic data exchange, supporting a variety of protocols including HTTP and SMTP. With features like extensibility, reliability, and adherence to WS-* standards for security and transactions, SOAP web services are designed for robust and secure interactions in distributed environments.
